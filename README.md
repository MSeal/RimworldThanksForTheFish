A simple fishing mod designed to provide a food supplement to colonies with access to water.

Adds a fishing sub-skill to Animal Handling which is used at FishingSpots (under the Production Tab) to fulfill fishing bills. Fish are like other animal corpses and can be butchered and cooked, though they do rot a little faster so freeze them within a day or so.

FishingSpots have a few basic restrictions. They must be placed in deep water. You can't place two within 10 squares of each other. And finally you need at least 5 squares of water (deep or shallow) to fish.

Fishing is sped up by the Animal Handling skill, and has a slow skill gain attached as a benefit for fishing all day.

## FAQ:
#### Aren't there other fishing mods already? Why make this one?

> I found other fishing mods to either make the game significantly easier or to add a ridiculous number of items, buildings, and food types. This mod aims to be a balanced addition to the game. If you're low on food, or your crops got blighted, or a tornado ruined your harvest – you can do some fishing for a quick fix of your food problem. Additionally high animal handling skill can be applied to utilize specialized pawns and make a more reliable source of food for your colony. And it makes a great past time for hats while your sewing machine processes the rest of your leather.

#### Can I add this to an existing game?

> Yes. But you might not be able to remove it once used in a save.

#### Can you change how long it takes to fish?

> Yes. Go to the Mod Settings under Options and adjust any of the settings you feel should be different for your current colony.

#### Is this mod why my game is slow when I load 10000 raiders?

> No. But it does lag if you also install Rainbeau's Fishing mod with this mod (uninstall one of the two to fix).

#### Can I live off just fishing?

> Many coastal tribes have proven successful in doing just this throughout history. Most of those also weren't known for their wealth. Jokes aside a zero skill worker can fish ~11 times in a normal day, which can feed 2-3 people for a day if cooked. A 20 skill worker can feed about 8 people a day. This is quite a bit less efficient per unit of time than other food sources. Try a fishing-only run for a challenge.

#### What was that flying by my screen?

## Changes

#### 1.0.0
> Rimworld 1.0 Support

#### 0.19.6
> Improved graphics and russian translation.

#### 0.19.5
> Fishing made more mod friendly. Now adding a "Fishable" tag to terrain types will allow for fishing there. Additionally a "NoFishingRules" tag on terrain will skip checking for water size / distance from other fishing spots. This should enable making custom terrain changes to fit other modding ideas without changing TFATF directly.

#### 0.19.4
> Fix for fish meat rotting in RimFridge's coolers (and maybe other situations?). Thanks mrStorrs for finding a fix, as it doesn't occur for all user setups!

#### 0.19.3
> Added configuration of fishing spot min distances, and fishing work cost to mod settings. Edit these under Options -> Mod Settings.

#### 0.19.2
> Added audio support for Mac / Linux.

#### 0.19.1
> New butcher spot can now clean fish.

#### 0.19.0
> Beta 19 support!

#### 0.18.3
> Added support for Tribal Essentials and Medieval Times mods' butchering stations.

#### 0.18.2

#### 0.18.1
> Changed fish butchering to new quicker bills "Clean Fish" and "Clean 8 Fish".
