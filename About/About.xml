    <description>[B18] Basic Fishing mod

A nice description here (maybe with some sarcastic note about how everything causes lag).

Basic functionality in place. Setup a Fishing Spot from the Production Tab, add a Catch Fish bill, make sure Animal Handling skills are active. Pawns should now fish for you.

Fishing is sped up by Animal Handling skill, but it provides no skill-ups.

WARNING: NOT balance tested yet
- is fishing speed too fast/slow?
-- with 0 skill
-- with 10 skill
-- with 20 skill
- do yields make sense?
- does fish rot too slow/fast when not refrigerated?
-- meant to be a fast rot food; adds risk of heat waves/solar flares wiping it out when other foods would last
- is that fishing reel sound too loud?

TODOs:
- get a better fish graphic
- change the fishing spot graphic
- add language translations

Version: 0.18.1
